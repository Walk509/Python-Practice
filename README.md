Practice Notebooks for Python

The first notebook is a series of algorithms from leetcode. I found out about this site and am using it to improve my skills as I am learning. My plan is to work on at least one each day. If you have any comments on how I can improve please let me know. But be prepared if I dont understand I will question you on how it works. Also be nice. I am learning.
